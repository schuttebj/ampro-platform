- Minimal manual intervention required in the process 

## Proof of Concept Infrastructure

### Server Requirements
- **Application Server**:
  - 1 x server with 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD
  - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar Linux distribution
  - Docker for containerized deployment
  - Nginx as reverse proxy

- **Database Server**:
  - 1 x server with 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD
  - PostgreSQL 15 or higher
  - Configured with proper indexing for large datasets

- **Development/Testing Environment**:
  - Local development machines
  - Docker Compose setup for local testing
  - CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar

### Cost-Effective Setup Options
- **Cloud Providers**:
  - Digital Ocean - Basic Droplets ($20-40/month)
  - AWS Lightsail or t3.medium EC2 instances
  - Google Cloud Platform e2-standard-2 instances
  - Azure B2s instances

- **Database Alternatives**:
  - Self-hosted PostgreSQL on VPS
  - Managed DB services with free tier (AWS RDS, Azure Database)
  - Use database sharding for improved performance

- **Cost Optimization**:
  - Utilize auto-scaling for non-prod environments
  - Implement resource limits on containers
  - Use spot instances for development/testing
  - Leverage free tier services when possible

### Demo Data Generation

#### Dummy Database Structure
- **Database 1: Citizen Identity Database**
  - Personal information (name, birthdate, etc.)
  - ID numbers and document history
  - Address information
  - ~3 million records

- **Database 2: Driver Qualification Database**
  - License categories and restrictions
  - Test results and qualification dates
  - Medical information and conditions
  - ~2 million records

- **Database 3: Infringement Database**
  - Traffic violations
  - Penalties and suspensions
  - Payment records
  - ~2 million records

#### Data Generation Strategy
- Utilize Python Faker library for realistic data generation
- Implement database-specific schemas matching real systems
- Create data generation scripts with configurable parameters
- Generate consistent IDs across databases to simulate real interconnected systems
- Implement data anomalies and inconsistencies to test reconciliation
- Create test scenarios with varying complexity levels

#### Performance Testing
- Load testing with gradually increasing concurrent users
- Simulation of peak processing periods
- Database query optimization testing
- Response time and throughput measurements
